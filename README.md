Hangman is a simple game that revolves around guessing a randomly chosen word.

The player gets to choose an alphabet every round.
If the alphabet does not exist in the chosen word, the player will receive one strike.
After receiving a certain number of strikes, the player loses the game.
The player will win the game if he/she correctly guesses all the alphabets.
The bigger part of the DOM is generated by javascript.
